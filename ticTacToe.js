/*
As little as possible in Global State

1. gameBoard module
  - Array for the tic tac toe.
  - Must control the flow of the game itself.
2. Player factory function
3. displayController module

âœ… Render the contents of the gameBoard array to the page.
  - Manually fill in the X's and O's for now
  - Use a 3x3 Grid

Build functionality that allows players to add marks to specific spot on the board.
  - Tie it to the DOM
  - Can't click on something already selected

Each piece of functionality should be able to fit in the game, player or gameboard objects.
  - Put the functionality into logical places

Make sure that logic is built to decide a winner.

Allow players to put in their names.
Include a start / restart the game button.
Display element that congratulates the winner
